                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Lead a group of students in designing, analyzing the controls
                        characteristics and flight performance of a scaled down RUAV
                        tailless supersonic business jet using stability theory and wind
                        tunnel tests.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Conduct wind tunnel/CFD analysis and flight tests of RUAV to
                        analyze flight performance and controls characteristics to assist
                        in design of UAV and influence the construction and final flights
                        of aircraft.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Produce state space model and simulation of aircraft in which
                        winglet rudders and thrust vectoring replace the tail of the
                        aircraft by producing sufficient yawing moments; as a result,
                        these simulations are then compared to flight tests.

                <h3>Wingtip Vortex Energy Extractor Researcher<span>2014</span></h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Designed and built wingtip vortex energy generator designed to
                        reduce drag and produce power for onboard electronics that
                        resulted in the production of a technical AIAA format paper;
                        presented results to sixty person class.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Conducted water tunnel visualization to visualize vortex formed
                        on wingtip and completed wind tunnel tests of designs measuring
                        reduction of drag due to generator.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Produced CAD designs of generator and 3-D printed the generator
                        endcap using a MakerBot 3-D printer.
